            <h2>TREATY</h2>
            <p>Treaties are legal agreements between groups of people. Indigenous treaties were made between crown (Canada) and Indigenous people (First Nations, MÃ©tis and Inuit). Indigenous people agreed to share their land in exchange for goods, payments and promises. Treaties allow to foster relationships and their promises, making them as important today as at the time they were made.</p>

            <h2>TREATY ONE</h2>
            <p>Treaty 1 was signed in 1871. It was one of the first treaties between Canada and First Nations that lived around the area of what we now call Winnipeg, Manitoba. First Nations such as: Anishinabe, Swampy Cree Nations, etc. wanted to creat peacefull relationships with settlers and maintain their traditional land. As they saw changes that came with newcommers, they wanted security to transition to the new way of life, so they signed traties with Canada.</p>
