                <p tabindex="0">Treaties are legal agreements between groups of people, such as countries, nations or smaller groups that share common goal. Trieties are important part of Canadian history. There are many important trieties helping us to live in peace with eachother, many of which were set by the Crown with Indigenous people. Trieties differentiate from other agreements by being "binding" were both parties should do they're part of the promise. That's why is important to remember set treaties and fullfill them to the best of our ability.<br/>

Some nations’ foundational  treaties are with the land and the creatures we share the  land with, such as the Anishinaabeg. Others (e.g., the Haudenosaunee) use treaties to bind nations in a confederacy. Two Row Wampum 1613 This is among the first well-recorded treaties. The Haudenosaunee extend the Two Row Wampum to the Dutch. The treaty binds them together in respect for autonomy, peace and friendship. The Great Peace of Montreal 1701 Despite numerous treaties during early contact, conflict emerges. This agreement brings together 40 nations, including the Haudenosaunee and the French. The Treaty  of Niagara 24 First Nations accept  the Proclamation and translate it into their own diplomatic terms. Others reject the treaty and continue their conflict with the British in Pontiac’s War. The Numbered Treaties 1870-1921 Immediately following Confederation, Canada embarks on a national treaty-making campaign to secure land in the West for settlement. Over a period of more than 50 years, 13 treaties are made in what is now Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, northern British Columbia and the southern Northwest Territories. Series of Unnamed Treaties 1775-1850 A series of unnamed (and sometimes blank) treaties is created  to secure land for settlement in Upper Canada, ultimately forcing First Nations to move west. European settlers seek more land northwest of the Great Lakes by negotiating treaties. THE DOUGLAS TREATIES 1850 The Colony of Vancouver Island negotiates 14 treaties on the southern part of the island, permitting European settlement and offering support for the Songhees and Esquimalt bands, among others. Atlantic Peace and Friendship Treaties 1725-1779 This series of treaties between the English, Mi’kmaq and Maliseet peoples seeks to end long-term conflict. The treaties recognize Indigenous land rights, while providing the British with limited land access. Covenant Chain LATE 1600S Expanding their influence among European powers, the Haudenosaunee bring the English into their alliance with a series of treaties collectively known as the Covenant Chain. The Royal  Proclamation 1763 England emerges as the dominant colonial power after France’sdefeat in the Seven Years’ War.  To encourage peace with Indigenous nations, King George III recognizes their sovereignty west of the eastern British colonies and  begins a new era of treaty making"/>

            <p tabindex="0">First numbered treaty, Treaty 1 was nagotiated in 1871, by Crown and the Anishinabek and Swampy Cree nations of southern Manitoba. Treaty was signed at "Stone Fort" or as known now Fort Garry. As announced by Queen Victoria, the treaty were to be fair for both native people and Crown. In the treaty promise is written "Each band was to receive a reserve large enough to provide 160 acres for each family of five (or in like proportion for smaller or larger families). Each man, woman, and child was to be given a gratuity — or one-time payment — of three dollars, and a yearly annuity totalling $15 per family of five. The government also agreed to maintain a school on each reserve and to prohibit the introduction or sale of liquor on reserves."<br/>

Land should have been shared accordingly and Indigenous people should have the ownership of the land and it's recources. They were promised that "Your Great Mother, therefore, will lay aside for you ‘lots’ of land to be used by you and your children forever. She will not allow the white men to intrude upon these lots. She will make rules to keep them for you, so that as long as the sun shall shine, there shall be no Indian who has not a place that he can call his home […]". But as time passed many Indigenous people were resetled to worse and worse reserves, were it was harder to hunt and farm. It also took them from their native own land.</p><br/>

Indigenous people saw worth in education and therefore agreed to schooling to learn new perspectives. That mentionet education quickly became part of residential schools, forced assimilation, mistreatment, and saperation of families.</p><br/>
